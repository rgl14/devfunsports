        <h1>Exchange Rules and Regulations</h1>

        <h2>Part A - Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1. Use and interpretation</h3>
        <p>
          The Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part of
          terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets. The
          Exchange Rules also apply to Exchange ’Multiples’ product (see the
          Multiples section below for further details). The Exchange Rules
          consist of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>
          <li>The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);</li>
          <li>
            The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below – these apply to
            certain sports and to financial markets); and
          </li>
          <li>
            The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the tab
            entitled "Rules" or under the ‘Rules’).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the
          Market Information or the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any
          inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules,
          the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there is any inconsistency
          between the Market Information and either the General Rules or the
          Specific Sports Rules, the Market Information shall prevail, except
          where the General Rules or Specific Sports Rules use the phrase
          'regardless of what it says in the Market Information' or similar
          wording.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports
          Rules (e.g. ’Special Bets’ or beach volleyball), the General Rules and
          Market Information will apply.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Market information</h3>
        <p>
          The Market Information is provided for information purposes as an
          at-a-glance guide on how to manage the market. The Market Information
          may also contain rules on market settlement, however it must always be
          read in conjunction with the General Rules and the relevant Specific
          Sports Rules and a link to this Rules and Regulations page will
          usually be provided in the Market Information for each market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets will be
          managed, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it
          reserves the right to suspend any market at any time at its sole
          discretion, including in order to carry out necessary administration
          and/or to take any necessary action to protect the customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has been
          loaded except to correct obvious errors and/or to add wording to
          clarify the Market Information where appropriate.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Customer responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange Rules
          affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet. Customers
          should not simply rely on the Market Information as the Market
          Information is unlikely to contain all of the applicable rules
          relating to a market.
        </p>
        <p>
          By their nature ‘Special Bets’ markets are unpredictable so should be
          treated with particular caution. Customers are responsible for
          managing their own positions at all times in such markets. Customers
          should pay particular attention to the Market Information on ‘Special
          Bets’ markets to ensure they understand the basis on which the market
          will be administered and settled.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Customer betting disputes &amp; IBAS</h3>
        <p>
          Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the Exchange
          Rules or regarding the settlement of any market should contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has been
          settled then the customer should provide details of their grievance.
        </p>

        <h2>Part B - General rules</h2>
        <h3>1. Managing markets In-Play</h3>
        <h4>a) General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a
            market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but fails to suspend
            the market at the relevant time, then:
            <ul>
              <li>
                if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after
                that scheduled off time will be void; and
              </li>
              <li>
                if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use
                its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual
                'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will
                be void.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled
            to be turned in-play but fails to suspend the market at the relevant
            time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be
            void.
          </li>
          <li>
            It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets
            at the start of and at the end of the event. However, regardless of
            what it says in the Market Information, it does not guarantee that
            such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market
            that has been turned in-play.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all
            times.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that
            transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may be
            delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending
            on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
          b) All markets other than soccer markets and Australian markets - not
          suspending at the time of the 'off'
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play,
            aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play
            at the time of the 'off'. The time of the 'off' for such markets
            should be set out in the Market Information. However, regardless of
            what it says in the Market Information, it does not guarantee that
            such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the
            'off'.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend
            the market and cancel unmatched bets at the time of the 'off' and
            the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets cancelled at
            any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time
            of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound
            racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the
            scheduled 'off' time).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
            reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and
            all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend
            the market at the time of the 'off' (so unmatched bets are not
            cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned
            in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the
            time of the 'off' will stand
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
          c) Soccer markets (with the exception of Australian soccer markets) -
          not suspending at kick-off or on the occurrence of a Material Event
        </h4>
        <h5>Not suspending at kick-off</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned
            in-play, aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets
            in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of
            a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below).
          </li>
          <li>
            The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the Market
            Information. However, regardless of what it says in the Market
            Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be
            suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the
            market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at any time
            during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the
            kick-off will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the
            market at kick-off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that
            time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the
            match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off and
            before the first "Material Event" will stand. However, if there has
            been one or more "Material Events", any bets matched between the
            first "Material Event" and the market being turned in-play will be
            void.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
            Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched
            after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may
            take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is
            completed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Definition of “Material Event”</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a "Material Event" shall
            mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a player being
            sent off.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>d) In-play Australian markets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in relation
            specifically to any Australian market that is scheduled to be turned
            in-play, if it fails to suspend the market at the 'off' then all
            bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' and before the
            market is turned in-play will be void (in the case of horseracing
            and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather
            than the scheduled ‘off’ time). If the event does not have a
            scheduled 'off' time, it will use its reasonable endeavours to
            ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time
            of the 'off' as determined will be void.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Results and market settlement</h3>
        <h4>a) General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information and/or
            the Specific Sports Rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not specify
            how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets will be
            settled on the official result of the relevant governing body
            regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the
            result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the
            initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an
            error in reporting the result).
          </li>
          <li>
            If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the
            result will be determined by using information from independent
            sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public
            domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting
            reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the market should be
            reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or (ii)
            whether or not to wait for further information before deciding
            whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except it has announced
            that it is waiting for further information, any information that
            comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has
            been settled shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not
            such information may have led to a different result).
          </li>
          <li>
            In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential
            result, it reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market
            for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the
            reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right to void any market if
            the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to
            reasonable satisfaction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>b) Resettlements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in
            question. It may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the
            official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available
            to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer
            on a given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, it
            reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if: (i) the
            official result is different to the result on which initially
            settled the market (for example, a horseracing result being changed
            by the relevant governing body shortly after a race, but before the
            result is official); or (ii) if the whole market is eventually
            voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a
            market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical
            error).
          </li>
          <li>
            If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a
            customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions or
            for any exception under the Exchange Rules, if a market contains a
            statement that says, "All bets stand, run or not" (or something
            similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a team or
            competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the team or
            competitor starts the event or takes any part in the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets will
            stand regardless of participation, customers should refer to the
            relevant Specific Sports Rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after
            starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at least one
            other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or
            competitor completes an event (having started) then all bets will be
            void except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally
            determined.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>d) Winner with [named selection]' markets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the
            participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor named
            either in a 'Winner with …' market title or in the Market
            Information does not participate in the tournament or event then all
            bets on the market will be void. For example, if there was a "Winner
            with Federer" tennis market, all bets on the market would be void if
            Federer did not participate in the tournament. However, if any other
            competitor did not participate, then bets would stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they
            have taken part to the extent necessary to record an official result
            or classification (including any disqualification but excluding any
            "did not start" or equivalent classification).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
            Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, where
            a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
            Information in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or
            postponement the following shall apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or
            similar: If the event is not completed within three days after the
            scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event
            will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been
            unconditionally determined.
          </li>
          <li>
            In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event
            is not completed within three days after the scheduled completion
            date, then any markets relating to the event will be settled in
            accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body,
            providing such a decision is given within 90 days after the
            scheduled completion date. If no official ruling is announced in
            this 90-day period, then bets on any market relating to this event
            will be void, except for bets on any markets which have been
            unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been
            part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such part-settled bets
            will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a
            match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar). However, by way of
            example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa League outright =
            tournament; (ii) Champions’ League Group outright = tournament;
            (iii) Top Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf
            Match bet = match; (v) Ryder Cup outright = tournament; (vi) Golf
            tournament outright = tournament; (vii) Tennis Tournament outright =
            tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket Test Match = match; (ix) Ashes
            Series outright winner = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand
            Prix) = match.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Change of venue</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
            Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if
            change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules
            and/or the Market Information then the following shall apply:
          </li>
          <li>
            For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the
            market is loaded, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a
            home ground of the original away team
          </li>
          <li>
            For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the
            scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets will
            stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey
            match switching from grass to Astor-turf) after the market has been
            loaded, all bets will stand.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Periods of time</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
            Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if not
            dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information
            then the following shall apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market
            has been loaded but before the start of the event, then all bets
            will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the
            event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or
            injury time after any regular time period then it will be deemed to
            have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For example, if
            a goal is scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it
            will be deemed to have occurred on 45 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including
            stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not
            included.
          </li>
          <li>
            References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular number
            of 'days' shall mean the end of the day local time after the expiry
            of the specified number of days. For example, if a rugby match is
            scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule that allows the
            match to be completed within three days after the scheduled
            completion date (see Paragraph 3 above) would mean that the deadline
            for completion of that match would be 23.59:59 on the 4th of
            December.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Match bets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
            Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. For example,
            for match bets on Golf markets the rules are set out in the Specific
            Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports
            Rules or the Market Information then the following shall apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor or
            team with the best score, time or finishing position in the event.
            If none of the competitors or teams involved in the match bet
            complete the event or register a score, time or finishing position
            then bets are void unless specified otherwise in the Specific Sports
            Rules and/or the Market Information. Any competitor or team not
            completing an event or registering a score, time or finishing
            position having taken part in the match bet event will be settled as
            a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes
            that event or registers a score, time or finishing position.
          </li>
          <li>
            'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with multiple
            heats or rounds are determined by the competitor or team which
            qualifies to the furthest round (whether it takes part in the
            further round or not) or with the best score, time or finishing
            position in the final or same heat of that competition or event. If
            the relevant competitors or teams fail to qualify in the same round
            of the competition but in different heats then dead-heat rules will
            apply, irrespective of the finishing positions in their respective
            heats. Markets will be part-settled after the end of each round and
            any subsequent disqualifications, penalties or amendments to results
            or qualifications will not have any effect on the market. Where one
            or more of the competitors or teams are disqualified, for the
            purposes of settlement, the disqualified competitor or team will be
            deemed to have progressed further in the competition or event than
            all those eliminated from the competition or event prior to the
            disqualification, and will be deemed to have finished last (or joint
            last if there is more than one disqualification) of those still
            competing in the competition or event. Disqualification will be
            considered to have taken place at the time of the competitor's or
            team's removal from the competition or event by the relevant
            governing body, rather than at the time of the event which caused
            disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the
            event, then all relevant match bets will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration such
            that any competitor or team fails to complete the match bet, event
            or tournament for any reason other than withdrawal or
            disqualification then all bets will be void except for those on
            markets which have been unconditionally determined.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. "To qualify" markets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the
            Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. However, if not
            dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market Information
            then the following shall apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be
            determined by the competitor or team that qualifies under the terms
            set out in Market Information, whether or not they take part in the
            next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be
            settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent
            disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Dead heats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
            Market Information the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a market
            where there are more winners than expected (as set out in the Market
            Information).
          </li>
          <li>
            For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake
            money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of
            the number of winners expected (as set out in the Market
            Information), divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake
            multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual
            winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers on
            this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and
            the remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between
            three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the winners for a stake
            of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other
            side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is
            multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided
            by the number of actual winners (3)) to calculate the reduced stake
            (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200). The backer then
            receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced
            stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this example, Client A's net winnings are
            100 (400 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's net
            losses are 100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount
            paid to the traded price divided by the number of dead-heaters. In
            the above example, this would be 300 at the traded price of 4.0
            (1200) divided by 3; making 400 payouts and 100 net winnings.
          </li>
          <li>
            By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in a
            golf tournament but 7 players tie for 2nd place. In the "top 5
            finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the top 5
            market there would be 4 others designated winner’s places available.
            'Client A' has backed one of the winners for 300 at the traded price
            of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of this bet. When the
            event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the
            number of expected winners (4) divided by the number of actual
            winners (7)) to calculate the reduced stake (171.43) and the
            remainder given to the layer (128.57). The backer then receives the
            traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x
            171.43 = 685.72). In this example, Client A's net winnings are
            385.72 (685.72 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's
            net losses are 385.72.
          </li>
          <li>
            In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the
            purposes of this section of the Exchange Rules dealing with dead
            heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B' and 'appropriate layers'
            should, where relevant, be read
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9. Exchange Multiples</h3>
        <p>The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other
            will act as the counterparty to the bet.
          </li>
          <li>
            A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as one
            or more chosen selections in any individual event market.
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain
            multiple bets or to scale back stakes in certain circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that
            apply to each individual sport that relates to any leg of any
            multiple bet.
          </li>
          <li>
            The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is £1,000,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or where
            available lay or a mixture of back and lay selections. However,
            customers cannot have a combination of back and lay selections in
            any one leg.
          </li>
          <li>
            If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds for
            this leg will be "dutched" which means they will be combined to
            reflect the chances of any of the selections within the leg winning
            (if backed) or all of the selections losing (if laid). If customers
            wish to place a cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than one selection in
            any event market but not using "dutched" prices) they will need to
            enter each Exchange Multiple bet separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price ("BSP"),
            the odds available via the Exchange Multiples product will be
            broadly based on the relevant singles markets on the Exchange and
            any such winning multiple bet will be subject to commission as set
            out in the Charges' section of the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not be
            subject to commission, but the odds returned on each leg in such a
            multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from the BSP.
          </li>
          <li>
            A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for selections in the
            multiple to win and a bet on the same selections to place. For
            example, a £2 each way double represents a £2 bet on both selections
            to win and a £2 bet on both selections to be placed, with a total
            stake for the bet of £4. The number of places for each event in each
            way multiples bet are shown on the multiples win Market Information
            and do not change. Should the number of runners be equal to or less
            than the number of places available, the relevant place leg of any
            multiples bet will be void
          </li>
          <li>
            The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is £2. For
            example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet combinations) representing a total
            stake of £2.20 is permitted. However, a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet
            combinations) representing a total stake of £0.57 or a £1 double (1
            bet combination) representing a total stake of £1 will not be
            permitted. For customers betting in currencies other than English
            Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an Exchange
            Multiple bet will not necessarily be the equivalent of £2, though it
            will be calculated as described in the example above.
          </li>
          <li>
            If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are
            available for Exchange Multiples. Events available for Exchange
            Multiples will be those listed within any individual Exchange
            Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures for any given day). Not
            all markets will be available via the Exchange Multiples product.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection in
            any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void under the Exchange Rules
            (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that individual leg will
            be void and the Exchange Multiple bet shall be adjusted accordingly.
            For example, a treble including one void leg will become a double.
            This means that if customers have more than one selection in any leg
            (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one of those selections is a
            non-runner, the whole leg will be void. In the event that voided
            legs mean that an individual bet within a multiple becomes a single
            bet, then this single bet will stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples bets
            struck at BSP, if customers have more than one selection in any leg
            and one of those selections is a non-runner the leg will stand. For
            example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red Rum in an
            individual horse race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will
            become a back of just Desert Orchid.

            It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of Exchange
            Multiples, such as those including related contingencies (i.e. where
            the outcome of one event is likely to affect the odds on the outcome
            of another event). This may happen automatically at the bet
            placement stage. Alternatively, if such bet is taken in error, it
            may void the individual bet combinations which include two or more
            of the related contingency selections.

            the price of each leg and the overall multiple price that customers
            get will be fixed when the multiple bet is actually placed and
            customers will then be able to see these prices. For more details on
            this customer should refer to the 'help' files.

        <h3>10. Rules for Starting Price</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP bets
            (‘SP bets’) are therefore a type of Exchange bet. The SP is
            calculated as, by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets when
            the market is suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event. The
            details of this calculation are provided directly below.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be cancelled
            once it has been placed.
          </li>
          <li>
            A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection
            being calculated and bets matched when the event starts. The odds
            are calculated by matching SP backers and other Exchange backers
            against SP layers and other Exchange layers. The inclusion of other
            Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is necessary to ensure that:
            SP backers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange offers to lay if
            those offers could increase the SP; and SP layers get the benefit of
            unmatched Exchange offers to back if those offers could reduce the
            SP. Including unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also
            ensures that the bets of other Exchange backers and layers, which
            would otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is £10 for a lay bet
            and £2 for a back bet (or the currency equivalent in each case).
          </li>
          <li>
            Example 1: on selection A there is £1,000 of backers' stakes and
            £6,000 of layers' liabilities at SP and there are £500 of unmatched
            other Exchange back bets available to lay at an average of 5.0. If
            we ignored the Exchange market in this case the SP would be 7.0.
            However, this would leave other Exchange back bets, that could also
            have been matched at their requested price against SP layers,
            unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be 5.0 and all SP backers and SP
            layers will be matched at that price. The £500 of Exchange backers'
            stakes will also be matched at their requested price of 5.0 against
            the SP layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example 2: on selection B there are £831 of backers' stakes and
            £4,428 of layers' liabilities at SP and the following unmatched
            other Exchange lay bets, available to back: £20 at 6.8, £31.13 at
            6.6 and £100 at 6.4. In this case the SP will be 6.68. This is
            calculated by including the £20 available to back at 6.8 and the
            £31.13 available to back at 6.6 and balancing those amounts against
            the SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The £100
            available to back on the Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched as to
            include any of this amount would lead to an imbalance between SP
            backers and SP layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection,
            though it may be displayed in the relevant market view (or in any
            form/results data) to two decimal places, rounded up or down as
            applicable. After reconciliation, the full SP on each selection is
            available by clicking on the relevant individual runner graph.
          </li>
          <li>
            If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event starts
            or the SP cannot otherwise be reconciled at the 'off’, it will
            determine the SP using all available information. For the avoidance
            of doubt this information will not be limited to betting activity on
            the relevant market(s). Also in these circumstances, a licensed
            betting operator within the group may act as risk counterparty to SP
            bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP. The personnel involved in
            determining the SP in such circumstances will have no undeclared
            personal or other interest in the SP in question.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for
            example if a horserace is turned in-play in error), then it will
            endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so that the SP is determined
            when the event starts. There may however be circumstances in which
            this is not possible, in which case the SP will be based on the
            initial reconciliation.
          </li>
          <li>
            In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets (including
            SP limit bets), 'At In-play: Take SP' bets and 'At In-play: Keep'
            bets will all revert to their status before the reconciliation; and
            'At In-play: Cancel' bets will either remain cancelled if not
            matched as part of the reconciliation process, or if matched as part
            of the reconciliation process, will revert to their unmatched status
            before the reconciliation.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled
            (i.e. after the event has started) and determines that a material
            event has occurred (this will generally mean that the event is not
            turned in-play), the SP will be determined based solely on SP bets
            (and ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets which are unmatched when suspends
            the relevant market), placed before the 'off'. This means that ‘At
            In-play: Take SP’ bets matched after the off, will be made void and
            not included in the reconciliation process. In addition, SP bets
            placed after the 'off' will be voided. However, if the SP
            reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled but
            determines that no material event has occurred, all bets will stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as two
            separate bets: a win bet at SP and a 'to be placed' bet at SP.
          </li>
          <li>
            If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market
            going in-play, then any unmatched bets that have been selected to
            'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted to SP bets. Once those bets
            are converted, they cannot be cancelled.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other customers.
            However, during the reconciliation of the SP, it acts as
            counterparty in order to balance liabilities between SP bets and
            other Exchange bets
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Placing a SP bet</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two
            different ways to request an SP bet. These are as follows:
          </li>
          <li>
            The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP odds
            limit' box unticked at the top right of the bet manager. For a back
            bet you are required to enter the stake you wish to bet on the
            selection. For a lay bet, you are required to enter the liability
            you are prepared to risk against the selection – in other words the
            amount that you are prepared to lose, should the selection win (or
            be placed as applicable).
          </li>
          <li>
            The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP odds
            limit' option. Using this you can request a bet at SP conditional
            upon minimum SP odds in the case of a back bet, or maximum SP odds
            in the case of a lay bet. If SP is shorter than the minimum price
            requested by a backer or is longer than the maximum price requested
            by a layer, then the relevant bet will lapse when the event starts.
            If SP is longer than the minimum price requested by a backer or is
            shorter than the maximum price requested by a layer, the bet will be
            matched at the SP. Where an SP is equal to the price limit specified
            by customers, those bets will be included based on the time they
            were submitted, on a first come, first served basis as is the
            existing convention for other Exchange bets. This means that such
            bets may be unmatched or partially matched.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the relevant
            market until after the completion of the event, the application to
            all bets matched at or before the "off" (including SP bets) of any
            reduction factor, may mean that the matched price for an SP back bet
            with an odds limit requested, is adjusted to a price below the lower
            limit requested. It may also mean that an SP lay bet request with
            maximum odds requested, may not be matched even though the odds on
            the selection, after any post-race adjustment for the late
            non-runner, is below the maximum odds requested.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the minimum/maximum
            odds requested can be shortened in the case of a back bet or a
            lengthened in the case of a lay bet at any time before the event
            starts. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet request cannot
            actually be cancelled by a customer once it has been placed. Details
            of the impact of non-runners on the SP re provided below.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of your
            selection from the market view (as opposed to clicking on the 'SP'
            of your selection). When such an Exchange bet is fully or partially
            unmatched it can be adjusted and cancelled in the normal course.
            Previously, unmatched bets were automatically cancelled when a
            market was suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event. You can now
            choose to either have your unmatched Exchange bet convert to an SP
            bet when the market suspends at the start of the event, or to have
            the bet 'persist' when the event goes in-play (see the 'keep' option
            below).
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet when
            the market suspends you should select the 'At In-Play: Take SP'
            option in the bet manager. If there is a non-runner in a win market
            with a reduction factor of at least 2.5%, or a non-runner in a place
            market with a reduction factor of at least 4%, it is policy to
            cancel unmatched lay bets on all other runners in the market. In the
            case of any such non-runner, instead of being cancelled a lay bet
            for which the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option has been selected, will
            automatically convert to an SP bet. After this conversion, the bet
            cannot be cancelled. Otherwise, unlike an SP bet, you can choose to
            cancel an Exchange bet once it has been placed, even if you have
            chosen for the bet to persist or to convert to an SP bet at the
            start of the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP bet,
            the liability of your Exchange lay bet will be converted into a
            liability for the SP bet. Your liability for that SP bet will never
            be more than the liability for the Exchange bet you had specified.
            However, the amount you can win on the SP lay bet may differ from
            the amount you would have won had the Exchange bet been matched,
            depending on the final SP.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the
            odds requested by a customer, despite any non-runners or
            withdrawals. However, customers who have selected the SP limit
            option can reduce the minimum SP odds they are prepared to accept on
            a selection.
          </li>
          <li>
            For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's
            liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any non-runner(s) and
            the reduction factor of the runner on which the customer's bet has
            been placed. This is to ensure that the balance between the backers'
            stakes and the layers' liability reflects the revised market after
            the runner has been removed. For example, if a horse with a 50%
            reduction factor becomes a non-runner, then another horse in the
            same market priced at about 5 (i.e. a reduction factor of 20%) will
            change to a price of about 2.5. Therefore, the liability on a £200
            lay bet on that runner will need to change to a liability of about
            £75 to ensure that a balancing back bet will have the same £50
            stake. This is done by multiplying the liability by 37.5% (i.e.
            100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).
          </li>
          <li>
            Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit
            specified, this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of any
            non-runner, if the non-runner has a reduction factor of at least
            2.5%.
          </li>
          <li>
            For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a customer's
            liability based on the reduction factor(s) of any non-runner(s) but
            the calculation will be slightly different, in line with the
            application of place market reduction factors. The liability will be
            reduced by the reduction factor of the removed runner. Where the lay
            bet on a place market has a maximum odds limit specified, the
            potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the odds – 1) will be reduced by
            the reduction factor of the removed runner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit
            specified this limit will be reduced by the reduction factor of any
            non-runner.
          </li>
          <li>SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.</li>

        <h3>11. 'Keep' bets option</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the 'off', a
            customer can request that an unmatched Exchange bet should not be
            cancelled when the market is turned in-play. This is done by
            selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option in the bet manager (and
            confirming that request) and means that the unmatched bet persists
            when other unmatched bets are cancelled at the start of the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a horseracing
            market (apart for late withdrawals as described in the next bullet
            point below), it is policy to cancel unmatched offers to lay all
            other horses in the market if the non-runner has a reduction factor
            of 2.5% or greater for win markets, or 4.0% or greater for place
            markets. In these circumstances offers to lay a horse with the 'At
            In-Play: Keep' option selected will not be cancelled. Instead the
            lay odds offered in place markets will be reduced in proportion with
            the reduction factors of any non-runner(s) and the same will apply
            in win markets providing the relevant non-runner has a reduction
            factor of at least 2.5%.
          </li>
          <li>
            When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the
            non-runner from the market before turning it in-play. In such cases
            if can determine that the late withdrawal is a material runner (i.e.
            a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 20% or greater in the
            win market), it reserves the right to cancel ALL lay 'keep' bets (in
            both the win and ‘to be placed’ markets) before turning the market
            in-play. If it does not cancel lay 'keep' bets in the case of a late
            withdrawal (for example, it may not be possible to know which horse
            is withdrawn, at the time of the off), any such bets placed before
            the off and matched in-play will remain at the original selected
            price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be subject to
            any reduction factor which as a result of the late withdrawal, will
            be applied after the completion of the race to bets matched at or
            before the 'off'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel 'keep'
            bets to protect customers but, unless stipulated in the market rules
            or the market information, the general principle is that at no point
            will a 'keep' bet be cancelled by unless it remains unmatched when
            the market is closed (for the final time) at the end of the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a
            Material Event occurs in a soccer match and other unmatched bets are
            cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet will not be
            cancelled.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>12. Rules for Tote betting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or South
            African Tote bet), you are betting against as counterparty to your
            bet. I will then strike a corresponding bet into the relevant Tote
            pool as applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as counterparty
            is provided within each of the relevant. If there is any conflict
            between those rules and either: the equivalent rules available on
            the relevant Tote website (for example on the UK Tote website in the
            case of UK Tote bets); or the equivalent rules applied by the
            relevant host racetrack, the rules on the relevant Tote website or
            applied by the relevant host racetrack, will prevail.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>13. Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to the
            time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a reference
            to the start time of a football match, relates to the local kick-off
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot accept
            liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any information,
            such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores, results or
            general statistics.
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take
            all reasonable steps to ensure markets are administered with
            integrity and transparency.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding
            minor spelling mistakes) or the incorrect number of teams,
            competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a
            market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information (for example
            the application of an incorrect exposure algorithm or a cross
            matching tool utilising an incorrect algorithm) or includes any
            obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of the cross matching
            tool, then It reserves the right to suspend the market and
            (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets matched on the
            market.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves
            that the selection on which they place a bet is their intended
            selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the same
            name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the
            onus is on the customer to ensure that they know which competitor It
            has loaded into the relevant market and to ensure that they are
            placing their bet on their chosen competitor.
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute
            discretion to suspend an Exchange market.
          </li>
          <li>
            It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend
            betting on a market at any time (even if such suspension is earlier
            than anticipated by the Exchange Rules). In the interests of
            maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets, it may also void
            certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety.
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect customers
            at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to
            <ul>
              <li>winnings/losses on bets; and</li>
              <li>commission charges</li>
            </ul>
            will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places (with
            the exception that rounding will always be down (and never up) in
            respect of amounts relating to winnings/losses in respect of BSP
            bets). By way of example, £3.333, will be settled as £3.33, whereas
            £3.335, will be settled as £3.34 (except that it will be settled as
            £3.33 in respect of an amount relating to winnings/losses in respect
            of BSP bets).
          </li>
          <li>
            The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other
            than English for reference only. In the event of any differences
            between the English version and the non-English version, the English
            version shall prevail.

            play must have elapsed; or (b) an official result must be 'called'
            by the relevant governing body; otherwise all bets will be void,
            except for those on markets which have been unconditionally
            determined. In those instances, if the scores are tied then all bets
            on the outright match winner market will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            For 'Individual player' markets, bets shall be void on any player

            Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled on
            the official result of the relevant governing body at the time of
            the ceremony, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or
            amendment to the result.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be determined in

            a match starts but is abandoned or postponed in the second half and
            not completed within three days of the scheduled start date then the
            match shall be settled on the official result of the relevant

          <li>
            If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more
            greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number for

            heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds
            involved in the dead heat and the resulting number will be
            multiplied by itself to give the applicable multi-trap number (even
            if not a round number). By way of example: traps 1, 3 and 6 dead
            heat for first. Add these numbers up gives 10; divide this number by
            the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (3) which gives a
            resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by itself to give 11.11.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more
            greyhounds then to calculate the applicable multi-trap number for
            that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead
            heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds
            involved in the dead heat and the resulting number will be
            multiplied by the number of the winner to give the applicable
            multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By way of example:
            trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6 dead heat for second. Adding the
            numbers of the dead heating runners up gives 9; divide this number
            by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (2) which gives a
            resulting number of 4.5; multiple 4.5 by the winning number (1) to
            give 4.5.

          </li>
          <li>The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.</li>
          <li>

          <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>
          <li>
            For distances below half a length, the following scale will be
            applied: Short-head 0.1; Head 0.2; Neck 0.3.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the nearest
            whole number at the end of the meeting (rounded up, if half) and
            bets will be settled on this result.
          </li>

            finishes the race bets are void. If only one of the greyhounds
            finishes the race, that greyhound will be deemed the winner. If a
            non-runner or reserve runner is declared then all bets will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the
            greyhound which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it runs in
            the further round or not). If the greyhounds concerned fail to
            qualify in the same round of the competition then the market will be
            settled as a dead heat, irrespective of their finishing positions in
            their individual heats.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the

            runners when the market is loaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets (as set

            qualify in the relevant heats irrespective of whether they run in
            the next round or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 'reach the final' or 'to qualify' markets will be settled after
            the qualifying stages and any subsequent disqualification or
            amendment to results will not count.

        <h4>➢ Ante-post</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the
            available information to determine the time of the greyhound's
            death. It will then, acting reasonably, determine whether the
            greyhound was a 'material runner' in the market. In determining
            whether a greyhound is a material runner, it will look at the
            general price of the greyhound immediately before the greyhound's
            death, in the market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it
            will consider a greyhound to be a material runner if it is deemed to
            have an approximate chance of winning of 8-10 per cent or better.
          </li>
          <li>
            If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner', then
            all bets struck in the market (on all selections) between the time
            of death and the suspension of the market will be void and all
            unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is reopened.
          </li>
          <li>
            If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner',
            then just bets struck on the greyhound in question between the time
            of death and the suspension of the market will be void and unmatched
            bets will not be cancelled before the market is reopened.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry at
            a particular entry stage or where they have not qualified by the
            applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in
            question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the
            same venue then ante-post bets will stand unless entries are
            reopened in which case all bets will be void.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Australian Specific Non-Runner Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Notwithstanding any of the above, the following rules apply to
            declared non-runners in Australian greyhound markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is
            loaded but prior to the commencement of the race it will be removed
            and all bets on the market, matched prior to the update of the
            market will be voided.
          </li>
          <li>
            If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a
            greyhound a non-runner, it will resettle the market and will void
            all bets that were placed on that runner only. It will then apply a
            reduction factor to all bets placed on the winner (or place getters
            in the case of place markets) based on that runner’s weighted
            average price.
          </li>

        <h3>14. Horseracing</h3>
        <h4>➢ General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All individual race markets will be determined according to the
            official result at the time of the 'weigh-in' announcement (or
            equivalent). Subsequent disqualifications, appeals or amendments to
            the result will be disregarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a race is abandoned or otherwise declared void, or in the event
            of a walkover, all bets on that race will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been loaded,
            all bets will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where a race does not take part on its scheduled day, all bets will
            be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a scheduled surface type is changed (e.g. turf to dirt) all bets
            will stand.

          <li>
            Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on ‘day of the race’
            markets (and not ante-post markets). Horseracing ante-post rules do

        <h4>➢ Ante-post</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subject to the points below, in ante-post markets, all bets on an
            individual horse stand whether the horse runs or not.
          </li>
          <li>
            For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all bets on
            that horse will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the
            available information to determine the time of the horse's death. It
            will be acting reasonably, determine whether the horse was a
            'material runner' in the market. It will undertake a similar
            determination in cases where it is advised through official channels
            that a runner has been formally scratched from an ante-post race. In
            determining whether a horse is a material runner, it will consider
            the general price of the horse immediately before the horse's death
            (or immediately before being advised it has been scratched), in the
            market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it will consider a
            horse to be a material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate
            chance of winning of 8-10 per cent or better.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it determines that the horse was a 'material runner', then all
            bets struck in the market (on all selections) between the time of
            death (or the time that the formal scratching notification was
            created) and the suspension of the market will be void and all
            unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is reopened.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it determines that the horse was not a 'material runner', then
            just bets struck on the horse in question between the time of death
            (or the time that the formal scratching notification was created)
            and the suspension of the market will be void and unmatched bets
            will not be cancelled before the market is reopened.

          <li>
            Bets matched on horses after they have forfeited their entry at a
            particular entry stage or where they have not qualified by the
            applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race in
            question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.

          <li>
            Please be aware that runners who have not been entered at the

            all matched customer bet prices set to 1.0 even if there are later
            supplementary stages. Should it appear likely that a specific runner
            may actually be supplemented into the race this runner will be
            reinstated with all matched customer bets set back to the original
            prices.

          <li>No Non-Runner Rule' reductions are made to ante-post bets.</li>
          <li>
            All relevant bets will be void where an event is: abandoned and not
            rescheduled; or postponed and rescheduled to another venue; or
            postponed and rescheduled to another day at the same venue with
            entries for the race being reopened or reverting back to a previous
            entry or declaration stage provided any additional horses are
            entered or re-entered and such entries or declarations are
            considered, in absolute discretion, material to the betting on the
            race. For the avoidance of doubt, where a race is postponed and
            rescheduled to another day at the same venue, relevant bets will
            stand where entries/declarations at the time of postponement remain
            unaltered or include any non-material addition(s) prior to the
            rescheduled race.

        <h4>➢ Place Terms for Exchange markets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the
            Market Information and is determined with reference to the number of
            runners when the market is loaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets will
            not be affected by further non-runners.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the number of winners stated in the Market Information is equal
            to or is greater than the number of runners, all bets in this market
            will be void.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the number of placed horses is less than the number of potential
            winners listed in the Market Information, the winners will only be
            the placed horse or horses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ EW markets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The place portion of any "Each Way" bet will be settled according to
            the number of 'places' and at the fraction of the win portion profit
            stated in the market information.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: “EW Terms: 1/5th odds, 3 places”. That “1/5th” is
            applied to the traditional or fractional odds, which are 1 less than
            decimal odds, so the calculation of the Place odds corresponding to
            Win odds of 8.0 in this market is ((8.0 – 1) / 5) + 1 = 2.4.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once opened, the number of places in 'EW” markets will not be
            affected by further non-runners unless the number of ‘places’ which
            are offered on the ‘Each Way’ market is equal to or exceeds the
            number of runners in which case, the place portion of any EW bet
            will be voided at settlement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Winning Distance Bets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, winning
            distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances from each
            race on one particular day at a race meeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            The winning distance in a race will be the officially declared
            distance between the first two horses past the post. However, if
            either the first or second horse past the post is disqualified
            because: (i) of an incorrect weight carried; (ii) they have taken
            the wrong course; (iii) the jockey of either horse fails to weigh
            in, or weighs in light after the race; then in each case the winning
            distance shall be that between the first and second horse under the
            official result.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any individual
            race will be 12 lengths for Flat races and 30 lengths for National
            Hunt races (which includes National Hunt Flat Races) and these
            distances will be applied where only one horse finishes a race. For
            distances below half a length, the following scale will be applied:
            <ul>
              <li>Nose: 0.05 length</li>
              <li>Short-head: 0.1</li>
              <li>Head: 0.2</li>
              <li>Short-neck: 0.25</li>
              <li>Neck: 0.3</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If a meeting has three or more races abandoned or declared void,
            then all 'winning distance' bets will be void, unless the entire
            market has been unconditionally determined.
          </li>
          <li>
            When only one or two races are abandoned or declared void, then
            'winning distance' bets will be settled with a default distance used
            for each abandoned or void race. The default distances are 2 lengths
            for Flat races and 10 lengths for National Hunt races.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of a walkover the following distances will be applied:
            <ul>
              <li>Flat: 5 lengths</li>
              <li>National Hunt: 12 lengths</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ Non-Runner Rule</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets already
            matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner. In order to
            make the adjustment applies a reduction factor to the remaining
            runners. The reduction factor allocated to a non-runner is a
            calculation (the details of which are described below) of that
            horse's chances of winning (or being placed, etc. as appropriate)
            and is applied to bets already matched on the other runners in the
            relevant market or markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not
            subsequently come under starter's orders is deemed to be a
            non-runner.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor',
            based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a percentage. These
            reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion
            based on trading in the market, but after approximately 15 minutes
            (approximately 5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the
            scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will be updated only in
            exceptional circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but applied
            differently (as described below), and horses will have a different
            reduction factor for each market.
          </li>
          <li>
            As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a
            highly likely non-runner, following a statement to the press from
            connections, the following will happen:
          </li>
          <li>
            All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will be
            removed from the market.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is 2.5%
            or greater, the traded price of all the matched bets on the
            remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
            non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers to
            lay will be cancelled. If the non-runner's reduction factor is less
            than 2.5%, reductions will not be applied and unmatched bets will
            not be cancelled.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners will be
            applied (even if less than 2.5%) and the potential winnings in
            relation to matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by
            an amount equal to the non-runner's final reduction factor. Only if
            the non-runner's reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all the
            unmatched offers to lay be cancelled.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be adjusted
            to reflect their improved chance of winning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck in-play.
            However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by error (or, for
            example, there is a false start), all bets matched during this time
            will be subject to any later reduction factor, provided the market
            is turned out of play before the race commences. In the event of a
            late withdrawal, it reserves the right to remove the runner after
            completion of the race. In this case only those bets matched prior
            to the off will be affected by a reduction factor.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error or
            following incorrect information regarding a runner’s participation,
            it will reinstate both the runner and all previously matched bets
            associated with that runner. All bets made between the time of
            withdrawal and reinstatement will be void in both the place market
            and the win market. The reduction factor applied to matched bets at
            the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the original prices will
            become valid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the
            order in which they are brought to attention. If It becomes aware of
            more than one non-runner at the same time, it will remove the
            non-runners from the relevant markets in race card order.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or
            because of incorrect information regarding a runner’s participation,
            It reserve the right to introduce the missing runner into the market
            at any time prior to settlement (even after the race has been run),
            provided that It has determined that the missing runner is not a
            material runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx.
            2.5% or less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
            unmatched and matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not
            introduced before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be
            void. However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material
            runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new market will
            be loaded where possible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
            traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses will be
            reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0 etc. And these
            might be further reduced if another horse is subsequently declared a
            non-runner.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win price.
            The advertised place terms will then apply to the revised win
            prices.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
            traded price on all previously matched bets on other horses will be
            reduced by 25% - - traded price of 8.0 would become 6.0. If each Way
            terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the corresponding price for the
            Place portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential
            winnings on the bet only, and not the traded price.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
            potential winnings on all previously matched bets on the other
            horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0 would become
            6.25. For example, a £10 bet on a horse to be placed at a traded
            price of 8.0 would provide winnings of £70. If there is a non-runner
            with a reduction factor of 25% in the race, that factor will be
            applied to the £70 of potential winnings leaving potential winnings
            of £52.50. Therefore, the revised traded price will be 6.25.
          </li>
          <li>
            The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is
            subsequently declared a non-runner, however odds cannot be reduced
            below 1.01.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets but
            will have a non-applicable reduction factor until It has received
            confirmation that it is a confirmed runner, in which case an
            applicable reduction factor may apply to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a
            non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be applied to all bets struck
            on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those markets of
            such non-runner. Likewise, should a reserve runner become a
            confirmed runner but subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction
            factor applicable to such non-runner will be applied to all bets
            struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those
            markets of such non-runner.

            'Tournament points' and 'tournament tries' bets will apply to all
            playing time, including any extra-time in any match where an
            official result is declared.
          </li>
          <li>
            For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second
            half, the first half is deemed to have lasted 40 minutes, regardless
            of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or the try is scored in
            second half stoppage-time or extra-time, the result is 80.
          </li>
          <li>
            For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will count
            with the exception of 'first individual try scorer' markets where
            penalty tries will not count.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all bets
            will be void unless an official result is declared by the applicable
            governing body. Where an official result has been declared by the
            official governing body, that official result will govern match and
            handicap market settlement but all other markets will be void unless
            their result has already been determined at the point of abandonment
            (i.e. at the point of abandonment, it would not have been possible
            for the outcome of the bet to change had the match continued to its
            natural conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points have been
            scored at the time a match is abandoned: (i) a bet placed on 35
            points or more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii)
            a bet placed on 30-35 points to be scored would be settled as a
            losing bet and (iii) a bet placed on 40-45 points to be scored would
            be void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team to
            score last / team to score last try / last scoring play would all be
            void.

            If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a
            Material Event, it reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched
            after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may
            take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is
            completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a match has not started (or believes that a match will not have
            started) by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all
            bets will be void unless it has knowledge that the match has been
            rescheduled to be played within three days of its original start
            date.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and believes
            that the match will not have been completed by 23:59 (local time) on
            its scheduled start date, then all markets, with the exception of
            any unconditionally determined markets, will be void unless it has
            knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to be played within
            three days of its original start date. If it does have knowledge
            that the game will be played within three days and the game is
            played within three days, then all bets will stand except if the
            match is restarted from the beginning. If the match is restarted
            from the beginning then all bets matched before the market went
            in-play will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be void, except
            for any bets placed in-play on markets which have been
            unconditionally determined, which will stand.
          </li>
          <li>
            For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of play
            according to the match officials, plus any stoppage time. If a
            friendly match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and is not
            completed (i.e. the full duration of play according to match
            officials, plus any stoppage time) within three days of the
            scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those on
            markets which have been unconditionally determined. In the case of
            ambiguity over the official result from match officials, the outcome
            will be determined (acting reasonably) using information from

            If an official fixture lists different team details to those listed
            (for example, the team name, reserves, age group, gender, etc.),
            then all bets matched on the affected markets will be void. In all
            other cases, bets will stand (including instances where a team name
            is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in the name). If an
            official fixture is shown on the website under an incorrect
            competition name, then it reserves the right to void all bets
            matched on the affected markets.

            If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a
            season, it has finished within the relegation positions which are
            relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom three league
            positions), bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as
            winning bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified, thrown out or
            removed from a league (i.e. in circumstances other than those where
            it has finished the season within the relevant relegation
            positions): (i) if such team is disqualified, thrown out or removed
            from the league before the relevant season has started, all bets on
            the affected market will be void (and a new market will subsequently
            be loaded) and (ii) if such team is disqualified, thrown out or
            removed from the league after the relevant season has started (or a
            determination is made by the applicable governing body, during the
            season, that the team will be thrown out or removed from the league
            following the season’s conclusion), all bets on the affected team
            will be void. For the avoidance of doubt, if a points deduction is
            imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within the
            relegation places which are relevant to the applicable league, bets
            on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning bets.
          </li>
          <li>
            The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the first
            league game has been played. For the purposes of this rule, markets
            relating to individual matches will not be deemed to be "affected
            markets".

          <li>
            'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at the
            start of the match. 'Shirt numbers' bets will include own-goal
            scorers. Any player whose shirt bears no number will be allocated
            the number 12.

          <li>
            For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets), the
            first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of stoppage
            time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 - 10 Minutes"
            selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match. In other words,
            it runs from 0:00 until just before the clock hits 10:00. The "11 –
            20 Minutes" selection runs from 10:00 until just before the clock
            hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each of the other
            selections in this market.
          </li>
          <li>
            For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the league or
            competition stated in the Market Information count. For example, if
            a player joins a club mid-season any goals scored in a different
            league will not count, however goals scored for a different club in
            the same league will count. Own goals will not count.
          </li>
          <li>
            In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur, such as
            'number of corners', these will be determined on the basis of the
            number taken, rather than awarded.
          </li>
          <li>
            For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the number
            of corners taken, any goal scorer or the time of a particular goal,
            the result will be determined (acting reasonably) using information
            from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information
            comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it
            shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the market
            should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information;
            or (ii) to wait for further information before deciding whether to
            reinstate or resettle the market. Except it has announced that it is
            waiting for further information, any information that comes into the
            public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled
            shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such
            information may have led to a different result).

            The General Rules will apply for 'match bets'. However, in respect
